# Guardrails

This document formalizes **guardrails** for AI agents and humans working in this repository. It is derived from [Agent Context](agent-context.html) and is the single reference for constraints and conventions that must be respected when editing or adding content.

---

## Purpose

Guardrails ensure:

- Consistent use of terminology and document structure
- Correct cross-referencing and single source of truth
- No secrets in the repo
- Traceable gap remediation

## Domain rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Work item = Task** | Work items and tasks are the same entity. A **task** is a **work item** with **level = Task**. Do not treat them as separate concepts in docs or design. |
| **Methodology-agnostic** | The design does not prescribe agile, waterfall, or any specific methodology. Keep descriptions neutral. |

---

## Documentation conventions

### 1. Gap identifiers

- Gaps are tracked in [16 — Gap Analysis (TODO)](16-gap-analysis-todo.html) with stable identifiers **GAP-001**, **GAP-002**, etc.
- Reference gaps by id in chat or in other docs (e.g. "address GAP-003").
- When a gap is remediated: mark the item with `[x]` and optionally add a "Resolved: …" note.

### 2. Gap and remediation format

Each gap is written as a todo so progress can be tracked by toggling the checkbox:

```markdown
- [ ] **GAP-XXX** — **Title:** Description. *Remediate: …*
```

When resolved:

```markdown
- [x] **GAP-XXX** — **Title:** Description. *Remediate: …* Resolved: brief note.
```

### 3. Document numbering

- Design docs use a two-digit prefix (00–16) for ordering and stable filenames.
- New design docs use the **next** number (e.g. 17) and must be added to the [docs index](index.html).

### 4. Cross-references in docs

- Links between docs use the **built site** form with `.html` extension, because the published site is generated by Jekyll.
- Example: `[03 — Data Model](03-data-model.html)`.
- Source files remain `.md`.

### 5. Docs index

- The canonical list of design docs is [index](index.html).
- When adding a new doc, add a row to the table with: **title**, **link** (`.html`), and a **short description**.

### 6. Single source of truth

| Topic | Canonical doc |
|-------|----------------|
| Definitions (terms, SUDO, scope) | [00 — Definitions](00-definitions.html) |
| Data model (entities, schema, PostgreSQL) | [03 — Data Model](03-data-model.html) |
| MCP surface (tools, resources, context) | [04 — MCP Surface](04-mcp-surface.html) |
| Identifiers (GUID, slug, prefixes) | [08 — Identifiers](08-identifiers.html) |

When changing an entity or concept:

1. Update the canonical doc first.
2. Update any references in other docs.
3. If the change closes a gap, update [16 — Gap Analysis (TODO)](16-gap-analysis-todo.html) (mark resolved).

### 7. No hardcoded secrets

- Configuration (e.g. OAuth client IDs, database URLs, API keys) is documented as **environment variables** or **config keys** only.
- **Never** commit secrets, keys, or credentials to the repository.

## Summary checklist (for agents)

Before submitting edits:

- [ ] Terminology: work item vs task used correctly; methodology-agnostic wording.
- [ ] Gaps: any new gap has GAP-XXX id and correct format; resolved gaps marked with `[x]` and optional "Resolved".
- [ ] New doc: two-digit prefix, added to index with title, `.html` link, description.
- [ ] Links: inter-doc links use `.html` form.
- [ ] Canonical docs: entity/concept changes updated in 00, 03, 04, or 08 as appropriate, plus references.
- [ ] No secrets or hardcoded credentials.
