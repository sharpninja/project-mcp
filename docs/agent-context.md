# Agent context — Project MCP workspace

This file orients an AI agent (or human) working in this repository: what the workspace is, how documentation is structured, constraints and conventions, and how to build and serve the docs locally.

---

## Workspace description

**Project MCP** is a design and documentation repository for a **Software Project Management MCP server** and related applications. The repo currently contains:

- **Design docs** in `docs/`: canonical definitions, architecture, data model, MCP surface, tech requirements, deployment, identifiers, gap analyses, implementation plan, testing, deployment plan, web app spec, and mobile app spec.
- **Documentation tooling**: Jekyll (Ruby) in `docs/` with a custom layout; docs are published to **GitHub Pages** via the `Publish docs to GitHub Pages` workflow.
- **No implementation yet**: the plan describes a future .NET MCP server, Blazor web app, and Avalonia mobile app backed by PostgreSQL; code will be added when implementation starts.

The design is **methodology-agnostic** (no prescribed agile/waterfall). It covers enterprises, projects, work, work items, tasks, milestones, releases, requirements, issues, standards, keywords, and related entities, with a clear identifier scheme and MCP tool/resource surface.

**Note:** **Work items and tasks are the same entity**; a **task** is a **work item** with **level = Task**.

## Constraints and conventions (for agents and edits)

These conventions have been established in this workspace and should be respected when editing or adding content. A formal, single-reference version is in [17 — Guardrails](17-guardrails.html).

1. **Gap identifiers**  
   Gaps are tracked in [16 — Gap Analysis (TODO)](16-gap-analysis-todo.html) with stable identifiers **GAP-001+** when needed. Reference gaps by id in chat or in other docs. When a gap is remediated, mark the item with `[x]` and optionally add a "Resolved: …" note.

2. **Gap and remediation format**  
   Each gap is written as a todo: `- [ ] **GAP-XXX** — **Title:** Description. *Remediate: …*` so progress can be tracked by toggling the checkbox.

3. **Document numbering**  
   Design docs use a two-digit prefix (00–16) for ordering and stable filenames. New design docs should follow the next number (e.g. 17) and be added to the docs index.

4. **Cross-references in docs**  
   Links between docs use the **built site** form: `[03 — Data Model](03-data-model.html)` (`.html`), because the published site is generated by Jekyll. Source files remain `.md`.

5. **Docs index**  
   The canonical list of design docs is [index](index.html). When adding a new doc, add a row to the table with title, link (`.html`), and a short description.

6. **Single source of truth**  
   Definitions live in [00 — Definitions](00-definitions.html), the data model in [03 — Data Model](03-data-model.html), the MCP surface in [04 — MCP Surface](04-mcp-surface.html), identifiers in [08 — Identifiers](08-identifiers.html). When changing an entity or concept, update the canonical doc and any references (including the gap tracker if it closes a gap).

7. **No hardcoded secrets**  
   Configuration (e.g. OAuth client IDs, DB URLs) is documented as env or config keys; no secrets in repo.

## Building and serving the documentation locally

The documentation is a **Jekyll** site in the `docs/` directory. GitHub Pages builds it with Ruby 3.2 and publishes the `_site` output.

### Prerequisites

- **Ruby** 3.2 (or compatible; CI uses 3.2)
- **Bundler**: `gem install bundler` if not present

### Steps

1. **Go to the docs directory**
   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```
   This installs Jekyll and plugins from `docs/Gemfile` (e.g. `jekyll`, `jekyll-relative-links`, `kramdown-parser-gfm`, `webrick`).

3. **Serve locally (with live reload)**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
   - Jekyll will build and serve at **http://localhost:4000** by default.
   - The site is configured with `baseurl: "/project-mcp"` (see `_config.yml`), so the local root is **http://localhost:4000/project-mcp/**.
   - Use **http://localhost:4000/project-mcp/** to open the index and follow links; relative links in the built pages assume this base path.

4. **Build only (no server)**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll build
   ```
   Output is in `_site`. You can open `_site/index.html` in a browser, but for correct baseurl behavior use `jekyll serve` or serve `_site` with a server that handles the base path.

### Optional: match production base URL

To avoid `baseurl` confusion when clicking around, run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ""
```

Then the site is at **http://localhost:4000/** and links use no prefix. Note: this differs from production (GitHub Pages serves at `https://<user>.github.io/project-mcp/`), so use the default `baseurl` if you want to mirror production link behavior.

### CI

On push to `main`, the workflow **Publish docs to GitHub Pages** (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) runs `bundle exec jekyll build` in `docs/`, uploads `docs/_site`, and deploys to GitHub Pages. The live site is at **https://sharpninja.github.io/project-mcp/** (once Pages is enabled: Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions).
