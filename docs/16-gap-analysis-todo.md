# Gap Analysis — Remediation Tracker

This document lists **gaps** in the current design and documentation in **todo format** for tracking remediation. Each gap has a unique **identifier** (e.g. **GAP-001**) so it can be referenced in chat or in other docs. Mark items as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` and optionally adding a "Resolved" note.

**How to use:** Reference a gap by id in conversation (e.g. "fix GAP-003") or link to this doc. When a gap is remediated, check the box and add a short "Resolved: …" line.

**Categories:** Definitions & terms | Data model & schema | Identifiers | MCP surface | Web/Mobile & auth | Implementation plan | Security & compliance | Testing & deployment | Cross-cutting

**Note:** **Work items and tasks are the same entity**; a **task** is a **work item** with **level = Task**.
